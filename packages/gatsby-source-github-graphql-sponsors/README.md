# gatsby-source-github-graphql-sponsors

This subplugin fetches the sponsors and sponsoring users of a given user. The currently available option is to target the user through `login` key.

This repository doesn't fetch recursively and the target users must be explicitly specified.

See the example app under `/examples` for usage details.
